# Specification Quality Checklist: Whole cached responses and the endpoint's own Cache-Control

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The product is a library, so its users are developers and HTTP headers, coders and response
  models are the domain's vocabulary, not implementation details; the spec names no module, class
  or algorithm of the implementation.
- The three clarifications (FR-002, FR-006, FR-009) were answered on 2026-11-02; see the spec's
  Clarifications section. All items pass.
